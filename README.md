# libslab

A library for better chunk generation & dumping to protocol, as an alternative
to prismarine-chunk and friends.

The goal of this project is to provide version-independent representations
of common Minecraft protocol objects (chunks, blocks, etc.) to allow
for wider version support by Prismarine or other Node-based projects.
